"""FRED ingestion adapter for US macro series (CPI, fed funds, unemployment).

This is the first key-gated source in the project, and the gating rule from the
plan applies: the key is free (https://fred.stlouisfed.org), it is read from the
environment, and NOTHING in the default path requires it. A missing key raises
`MissingAPIKeyError` with instructions; callers (the CLI) catch it and degrade
gracefully to a trend-only signal rather than crashing.
